# Pizza Sales Data Visualization Project

I developed this project to showcase my skills in Power BI for visualization and MySQL for managing relational databases. All files related to the complete project are uploaded.

- **pizza_sales_data.csv:** This file contains the primary dataset, which I preprocessed using Python. The preprocessing tasks included date manipulation and string formatting. [ViewFile](https://1drv.ms/x/s!AtpsnM6_VxvMhxRsR4OO_yYUc6pe?e=gqMjV9)
